# 4D Array
1. Each Frame Shows a 3D Slice of a Fixed w-layer: In each frame, we set w to a specific layer (such as w = 0 , w = 1, etc.).
By iterating through different values of w in the animation, we show each 3D cross-section (a "slice" of w) one at a time.

2. Only x, y, z Coordinates Are Plotted:
  Within each fixed w-layer, we visualize x, y, and z positions in 3D space.
  The fourth dimension, w, is used only to distinguish which 3D slice is displayed, rather than being plotted as a spatial coordinate.
3. Colors Distinguish Each w-layer: The colors (e.g., red, green, black) represent different w-layers visually, making it clear which 3D layer (or "slice") is being shown in each frame.
